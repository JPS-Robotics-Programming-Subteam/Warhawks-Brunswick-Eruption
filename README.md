# TODO
1. New speed controlling. Get rid of the old one and make the moving speed a **constant value**. Ensure that you're
checking how far the trigger is pulled before calculating speed **AND TURN SENSITIVITY**.

2. LS click should turn off turning for alignment. LS click again turns it back on.

3. "Get rid of the magnitude flap thing."
